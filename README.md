# govulcanize

A golang version of the Vulcanize tool for Polymer.

Main differences in code output:

* Go's html package doesn't handle boolean attributes well (eg. `<div hidden=""> vs. <div hidden>)
* Go's html package will return a single node for the main document (so <!doctype html> may be lost)
